    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick stones and grits from the beans.

            Wash the beans and the waakye leaves. Add into the pressure cooker.
            
            Pour in water up to the minimum level on the pot.</li>
        <li>Close the valve of the pressure cooker and leave until it reaches full pressure (when it starts to whistle). This should take no more than 15 mins.

            Once it reaches full pressure, reduce the heat and leave for additional 10 mins to cook the beans.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool down naturally to depressurize. This should take around 20 mins. You can speed this up by running the top of the pot under a cold water tap for about 3 mins. Please note that I am referring to stove top pressure cooker here and not electric pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Once the pot is adequately cooled. Unlock the lid and check the beans, you want it to be tender already with a little bite so it can be cooked with the rice.</li>
        <li>Pour the beans with the cooking liquid and the waakye leaves into another pot. Wash the rice and pour into the pot too.</li>
        <li>Add more water if needed so there is enough to cook the rice. Add some salt and cover the pot.</li>
        <li>Allow the rice to cook. The time for this depends on the type of rice used. I always use golden/sella basmati rice as it holds up texture during cooking. Check your pack instructions if you are no sure.</li>
        <li>Take out the waakye leaves and serve with your favourite side.</li>
    </ol>
