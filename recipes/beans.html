    <p>Red red is a Ghanaian bean stew served with a side of fried plantains and often garnished with gari, a coarse toasted cassava flour.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cowpeas or Black-Eyed Peas</li>
        <li>Red Palm Fruit Oil (Dende)</li>
        <li>The West African Trio: Onions, Tomatoes, Chilies</li>
        <li>Plantain And Gari (Toasted Cassava Grits)</li>
        <li>Some Variations</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the beans in fresh water for about 2 hours or overnight, this makes the cooking process quicker. You can also soak the beans in hot water for half an hour before cooking. Cook the beans for 30 to 45 minutes until soft. </li>
        <li>Chop the vegetables. Saute the onions until caramelized then add the tomato paste.</li>
        <li> Add the garlic, fry about 30 seconds then add the ginger and tomatoes in and fry until they have cooked down. This should take 5 to 10 minutes. The scotch bonnet peppers can be added with the tomatoes. They are potently spicy so I advise you add them whole with just a prick to regulate the heat. Remove when serving. For heat junkies or the more adventurous, chop up and add half, whole or all two scotch bonnets for mighty fiery flavour.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked beans and vegetable stock then allow to simmer for half an hour on low heat. During this time you can prepare the plantains</li>
        <li>Take 4 plantains. Peel, slice, season with salt and deep fry or oven roast. </li>
        <li>Serve the dish garnished with a little gari powder</li>
    </ol>
