    <p>This is one of my favourite Ghanaian meals. It is delicious, warming, savoury and guaranteed to be one of your favourite Ghanaian dishes too. It is often made with poultry, stewing hen and smoked turkey but you can definitely make this with other meats like beed, lam, goat etc</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <p>Soup</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds chicken cut into pieces (preferably mature chicken or stewing chicken)</li>
        <li>1 pound smoked turkey cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 large tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 large onions</li>
        <li>4 inch ginger peeled</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon anise seed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rice Balls</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups rice long grain white rice jasmine</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>To make soup</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken generously with salt and season with black pepper to taste. Set aside for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Set aside your smoked turkey.</li>
        <li>Blend 1 large onion, 3 garlic cloves, ginger and 2 scotch bonnets. Add at most about ⅓ cup of water when blending to help smoothen out the mixture. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a very large pot, add your chicken and smoked turkey and immediately pour over your onion, garlic</li>
        <li>Mix well so chicken and turkey are coated, cover chicken and turkey and let it steam for about 30 minutes until chicken is cooked. Your smoked turkey is already cooked.
            In a separate pot, add 2 tomatoes, 1 onion, 2 garlic cloves and 1 scotch bonnet pepper. Pour over water and boil for about 30 minutes until tender.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To make Rice Balls</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place washed rice, salt and water in a pot and bring to a boil. You want to add just a little more water than is normally required to boil rice. The ratio of rice to water is usually 1:1 1/2. For two cups of rice you would usually add 3 cups of water, but we are adding 3 1/2 cups of water in this recipe. There is more water in this recipe than when making rice normally, this is to make it easier to mash rice together.</li>
        <li>Turn down the heat, cover rice and allow the water to absorb into rice. Do not touch your lid until all the water has been absorbed. This will take anywhere from 15-30 minutes depending on the size of the pot. The rice should also not burn because the heat should be very very low.</li>
        <li>Once all the water is absorbed, remove the lid taste test to make sure the rice is cooked and use a sturdy wooden spoon to mash and knead the rice against the side of your pot.</li>
        <li>Shaking the bowl in a circular motion (swirling it around) you will be able to form your rice into a ball. You may use clean hands to help you form into a perfect ball.</li>
        <li>To reheat rice balls you may remove plastic wrap and place in the microwave, alternatively you may place in boiling water with plastic wrap on to reheat, but ensure that water does not penetrate the plastic excessively or this will make the rice soggy.</li>
    </ol>
